# Real-time-Vision-Sensor-for-Volumetric-Flowrate-Estimation-in-Robotic-Fused-Filament-Fabrication.

Fused Filament Fabrication(FFF) process is an additive manufacturing method where we build a product by
depositing material layer by layer through a moving, heated
printer extruder head. The real time sensing and control of
different process parameters in the FFF process is important in
deciding the quality in terms of different properties of the finished
product. One of the important process parameters in FFF is the
output polymer flow rate. We can compute the output polymer
flow rate in the FFF process if we know the extrusion width
of the polymer flow. Extrusion width is the width of polymer
extruded through the nozzle. In this project, we have calculated
the extrusion width of the polymer flow in FFF with different
approaches based on computer vision. We used the videos of
the polymer flow taken at different deposition speeds to extract
the extrusion width. We tried different methods to improve the
latency in processing all the frames from each of the videos and
measuring the corresponding extrusion width from each of the
frames to achieve real time sensing of extrusion width.
